NPR's project of "A Silent Epidemic" (here is the link to the story http://apps.npr.org/mental-health/) is interesting that it vividly present the data with interactive graphics and illustrations.  I wish one day I can creat such cool stuff.

Questions for buidling this project: JavaScript, CSS, Python and HTML were used to build these webpages. How do these developer tools work together? What is Python's role in the project?
